### An Introduction to Machine Learning in Python 10/16/2017
Here is a brief outline of what we will cover
1) collect data
2) randomize data order
3) visualize data (any obvious relationships?  balanced num. of examples in each group?)
4) data prep.: mainly, training and evaluation split (~80:20), possible cleaning, normalizing too
5) choose a model
6) train the model
7) evaluate model
8) parameter tuning (e.g. num iterations, learning rate)
9) prediction

### An Introduction to Machine Learning in R 11/6/2017
We will be covering the [data.table package](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki) for exploratory data analysis.
If you want to participate in this meetup you will need to come with R already installed.  Here are some resources to help.
