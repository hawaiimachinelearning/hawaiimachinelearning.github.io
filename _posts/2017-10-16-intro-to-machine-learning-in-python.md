This meetup we were grateful to have Jeff Eliasen cover the basic steps in Machine Learning using the Python programming language. The aim was to provide a template of code that you can use to solve almost any machine learning problem:
1. **Ingest**: import the data into a local data structure
2. **Groom**: modify the data into some schema
3. **Split**: break the data into a training set and a testing set
4. **Select**: pick an algorithm apporpriate for the data and the situation
5. **Fit**: build a model of the data using the selected algorithm
6. **Predict**: compute new results from the model
7. **Display**: show a range of predictions from the model
