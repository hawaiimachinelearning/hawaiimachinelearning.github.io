The [Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Hawaii-Machine-Learning-Meetup/) is excited to host two study groups focusing on:
* [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) taught by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani from Stanford Online.
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 

These course provide a great foundation for statistical learning and deep learning, respectively.
