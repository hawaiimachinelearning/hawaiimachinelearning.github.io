We're excited to start the [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview) course/study group. We chose this course because provides a good introduction to the field of machine learning. It focuses on applications without going too in depth about the theory and math. It also provides a pretty comprehensive look at most types of machine learning techniques. It starts with the basics, then works up to deep learning and neural networks. Lastly, its taught in the two most popular languages for data science and machine learning: R and Python.

* **How do I sign up?**
You can buy this course for $10 on Udemy during their Black Friday sale until Cyber Monday. If you miss this sale, this course is regularly listed at $200, but it goes down to $10 or $15 occasionally.

* **When will we meet?**
We plan on starting in early December, and then going through one or two sections every week, with a "study hall" session every Saturday. We should finish the course by the end of March 2018. Scroll down for the Google Calendar timeline.

* **Questions?**
If you have questions send us an email at hawaiimachinelearning@gmail.com, or post to our [meetup discussion board](https://www.meetup.com/Hawaii-Machine-Learning/messages/boards/thread/51165873).

See you in the study group!
