## Competition Summary
Test your skills at Hawaii's first Machine Learning Competition. Whether you're a machine learning expert or just want to prevent the robots from taking over, everyone is welcome.

Your challenge is to predict online retail sales from transaction data.   Use any algorithm you like: train your own neural networks, grow your own decision trees, even spawn an AI to solve the problem for you.

If you are new to machine learning, come and join our weekly tutorial sessions to learn the fundamentals of machine learning.   If you are are experienced with machine learning, come and show off your skills.

Join us to advance the field of machine learning in Hawaii.

## Competition Details

### General Objectives
The competition will provide a low-pressure environment that

* Promotes machine learning in Hawaii
* Provides an opportunity to gain experience analyzing data
* Teaches fundamental machine learning techniques

This competition will be valuable to beginners looking to get a start in machine learning.  At the same time, this competition will be beneficial to machine learning experts who are interested in applying start-of-the-art techniques to solve real-word problems.

### Task
Participants are tasked with predicting sales transactions for online retail stores.  Methods developed in this competition will be readily generalized to sales forecasting tasks here in Hawaii.

### Evaluation
The competition will evaluate participants objectively using the data rather than subjectively based on human judgement.  Participants are ranked on how well they can predict test data (the ground truth is withheld from the participants).  The metric that we will use for ranking is the root mean squared log error which is standard for this type of problem.

###  Rules
* Participants can form teams of any size.
* Private sharing of code or data outside of teams in not permitted. It’s okay to share code if made available to all participants on the forums.
* Having multiple accounts per participant is not allowed.
* Participants can submit up to 5 submissions per day. Participants will be allowed to submit 2 submissions for evaluation on the test set.

###  Tutorials
We plan to hold optional tutorials to teach the fundamentals of machine learning.  The tutorials are created by machine learning experts.  Tutorials will be given in-person, but we will also try to stream the content.
* Tutorial 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
* Tutorial 2: Training and Prediction
* Tutorial 3: Cross Validation and Model Selection
* Tutorial 4: Model Ensembling and Blending
