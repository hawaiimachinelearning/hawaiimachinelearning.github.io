**Summary**:

Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Reality Capture (Laser Scanning, Photogrammetry, Augmented Reality) have become very prevalent in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry. In this presentation, we’ll discuss what these technologies are, how they are being used, and how they may be able to benefit from AI & Machine learning.


**Presenter: Chris Baze**

Chris has been working at Hawaiian Dredging Construction Company (HDCC) since 2009. He has served as HDCC’s BIM Manager since 2011 and been actively using and managing software and hardware from companies including Autodesk, Trimble, and Leica Geosystems. He has been in Hawaii since 2007 when he graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor of Architecture degree.
