The Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup is excited to host two study groups focusing on:
* [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) taught by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani from Stanford Online.
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 

These course provide a great foundation for statistical learning and deep learning, respectively. 

### How do I sign up?
You can sign up for the courses on the course websites linked above.  You can sign up to attend our meetups on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Hawaii-Machine-Learning-Meetup/). 

If you have trouble signing up for the courses, contact us on Meetup.  Alternatively, join our Slack group by emailing hawaiimachinelearning@gmail.com letting us know that you are interested in the study group and we'll invite you to our Slack group.


### What do we cover?
At our study sessions we discuss questions/additional topics related to the courses. If you would like to view some of the topics we covered in previous study groups, please go to the following links:
