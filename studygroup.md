We're excited to start the [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview) course/study group. We chose this course because provides a good introduction to the field of machine learning. It focuses on applications without going too in depth about the theory and math. It also provides a pretty comprehensive look at most types of machine learning techniques. It starts with the basics, then works up to deep learning and neural networks. Lastly, it's taught in the two most popular languages for data science and machine learning: R and Python.

* **How do I sign up?**
You can buy [this course from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn). This course is regularly listed at $200, but it goes down to $10 or $15 occasionally.

* **When and where will we meet and what will we do?**
We will meet every Saturday at 10:00 AM at [tea boss kissa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tea+Boss+Kissa/@21.2925164,-157.8474801,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x9773621ccf2a1a35!8m2!3d21.2931712!4d-157.8474104).
