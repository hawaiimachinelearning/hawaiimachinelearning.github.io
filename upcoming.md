### Study Machine Learning - Week 14: Neural Networks Part 2 (03/24/2018)


**Summary:**
This is the review session for our machine learning study group. The new material is from Section 32: Convolutional Neural Networks.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are one of the hottest areas in machine learning today. Developments in CNNs have redefined the field of computer vision and catalyzed the current Deep Learning revolution that we see today.

Feel free to bring your questions about earlier sections.
