This meetup we cover fundamental concepts in machine learning including:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - gather insights about the dataset
2. **Feature Engineering** - use insights and domain expertise to create features
3. **Model Selection** - use cross-validation and bagging to determine which model/features to use
