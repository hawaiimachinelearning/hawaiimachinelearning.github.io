### Time Series Clustering in R (3/19/2018)

**Summary**:

Identifying patterns in a pool of event data is hard.
Time-series clustering provides a bag of lenses to change the level of detail
when viewing and analyzing a collection of event data.

Jonathan Page presented time-series clustering techniques using the
`dtwclust` package in R and share his experience applying these techniques to
 mobile banking data in Kenya.
