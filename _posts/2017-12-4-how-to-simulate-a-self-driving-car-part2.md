In this meetup we continued our discussion on training a neural network to drive a car. In particular, we focused on the code and theory under the hood:

1. Why do we need three cameras?
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Data Augmentation

We concluded with a mini competition that challenged members to train a neural network that could drive fast.
