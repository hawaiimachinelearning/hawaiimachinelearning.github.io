### Study Machine Learning - Week 7: Kernel SVM & Naive Bayes (02/13/2018)


**Summary:**
This is the review session for our machine learning study group. The new material is from:
* Section 15: Kernel SVM
* Section 16: Naive Bayes

SVMs are motivated by a very elegant mathematical theory that makes heavy use of the so-called kernel trick. With the right kernel, SVMs can essentially be used to map input features into an infinite-dimensional feature space.

The well-known Naive Bayes algorithm is based on a simplifying independence assumption. Despite its simplicity, it is can be used effectively in many situations.
