The Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup is excited to host two study groups focusing on:
* [Statistical Learning](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) taught by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani from Stanford Online.
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera. 

These course provide a great foundation for statistical learning and deep learning, respectively. 

## How do I sign up?
You can sign up for the courses on the course websites linked above.  If you have trouble signing up for the courses, contact us on Meetup.  Alternatively, join our Slack group by emailing hawaiimachinelearning@gmail.com letting us know that you are interested in the study group and we'll invite you to our Slack group.
