Are you curious about machine learning at Google? Or maybe just how comfy the chairs on campus are? Come and find out! Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup in collaboration with the UH iLab are pleased to announce a talk with Laurence Moroney! Come to listen, feed your curiosity, and talk story!



## Hawaii Machine Learning Challenge - Tutorial 1

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering** â€“ EDA is one of the first
steps in a machine learning pipeline. It is where analysts gain intuition about the dataset.
Feature engineering is the process in which raw data is transformed into informative
representations (known as features). Feature engineering provides an opportunity for analysts
to impart their intuition and domain expertise into the machine learning pipeline.

In this tutorial we will perform EDA and feature engineering using the competition data.  R and Python code will be provided.
