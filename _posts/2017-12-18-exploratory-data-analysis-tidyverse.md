In this meetup Xun Zhu detailed the tidyverse package in R. 

**Summary**:
Tidyverse is a system for data exploration developed by Dr.Hadley Wickham himself. It's a set of precise vocabulary that rids of all the non-sense struggle between your most brilliant and insightful questions about the data, and their answers.  We used the package to analyze real estate data from [Zillowâ€™s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate) Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1).


**Presenter Information**:
Xun is a Ph.D. student currently working in University of Hawaii Cancer Center as a bioinformatician (a data scientist who works with biological data). As part of his job, he processes datasets that come in all shapes and sizes. Being able to quickly extract key information from unknown data is a crucial skill he learned over the years.
