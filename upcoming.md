### An Introduction to Machine Learning in Python (10/16/2017)

This meetup Jeff Eliasen will cover the basic steps in Machine Learning. The aim is to provide a template of code that you can use to solve almost any machine learning problems. 

We will be getting hands on experience.  So bring your computer if you have one! It will make it much easier to learn and also give you something to take home (i.e. working code). 

Pro tip: The easiest way to use Python on your computer is by installing [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
