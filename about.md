## [Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup]
Visit us at our next meetup where you will meet other professionals and enthusiasts interested in discussing all things on machine learning and AI.

We meet every first and third Monday at 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM at the Manoa Innovation Center's Ideation Room (Suite 160).  

### Topics of discussion
Our roles as organizers of this meetup is to:

1. *Host talks and presentations given by our members, academics, or people in industry. *
This is our main role. As organizers, we will work on contributing our own presentations to the meetup, but we want the focus to be on how the community in Hawaii is using machine learning.

2. *Promote an understanding of machine learning through study groups.*
This is of secondary importance.  We plan to organize study groups for members enrolled in or auditing online courses. We also plan to hold a periodic review session for the material covered in the course. 

3. *Organize local machine learning competitions and encourage participating in global competitions.*
We believe that participating in machine learning competitions is a great way to apply machine learning techniques and also a great way to learn new techniques.
